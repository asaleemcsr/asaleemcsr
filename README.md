- 👀 I’m interested in testing stuff on this test account!
- Testing testing, GitBook Sync
- GitBook, sync this for me too, thx.
- I love my sync.
- Syncs are cool, you should love syncs too.
- 1620s, "to occur at the same time," from Greek synkhronizein "be of the same time," from synkhronos "happening at the same time" (see synchronous). The transitive sense of "make synchronous" is first recorded 1806.
- aight, cool.
